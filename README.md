## What number does a bit that is turned off represent?

## What would you call a device that works with binary data?

## What are the words that make up a high-level programming language called?

The words that make up a high-level programming language is called key words or reserved words.

## What are the short words that are used in assembly language called?

The short two words that are used in assembly language is called mnemonics.

## What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?

The difference between a compiler and an interpreter is that complier is a program that translates high level language program into a separate machine language which can be executed by any time it is needed. Interpreter is a program where it translates each high-level instruction and immediately executes the instructions.

## What type of software controls the internal operations of the computer’s hardware?

The software that controls the internal operations of the computer’s hardware is the operating system. 

## What is pseudocode?

## What does a class specify about an object?

A class specify about an object by its components of programs and the actions of the class.

## Can you use C# alone to perform advanced operations such as creating GUIs, reading data from a file, or working with databases? Why or why not?

You cannot use the C# alone to perform advanced operations such as creating GUIs, reading data from a file, or working with databases because C# provides only the basic keywords and operators that we will need to build a program.
